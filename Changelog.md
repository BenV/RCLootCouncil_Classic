## Updated RCLootCouncil to v2.15.0.
Most of these changes are background stuff, and/or not related to classic, and thus redacted from here.

* **Auto Award**  
Auto Awards can now only happen on equip able items.


## Changes
#### Tier Tokens / Set Pieces
Reenabled auto pass, item type and item level for all tier token pieces and set pieces.

Added separate button categories for both tier tokens and set pieces.  
In this context, tier tokens are the actual armor tokens usable by specific classes.  
Set Pieces are any wearable items that are part of a set, i.e. "Tier 0, 0.5, 1, 2" and other sets.

#### Trinkets
Reenabled auto passing and item type of trinkets.

Note the trinket auto passing is based on Blizzard's class list from the retail dungeon journal.
You can always disable trinket auto passing in the options menu.

#### History Deletion
Added Diremaul release to patch mass delete.

## Bugfixes
* *The version frame incorrectly showed the core RCLootCouncil version in the list.*
