## Updated RCLootCouncil to v2.14.0

* ### Voting Frame
The ML can now right click candidates after a session has ended.
This basically allows for an entire redo of the session, particularly changing awards later than usual.
As a reminder you can always reopen the voting frame with "/rc open".

* ### Bugfixes
Reawarding an item to the original owner will now remove the old trade entry from the TradeUI.
