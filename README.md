# RCLootCouncil Classic
World of Warcraft Classic port of [RCLootCouncil](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/rclootcouncil).

Latest release is available at [Curse](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/rclootcouncil-classic/).

The [RCLootCouncil Wiki](https://github.com/evil-morfar/RCLootCouncil2/wiki) is also the official documentation source of features, although a few things have been removed from this version (see below).

## Description
This project is an direct extension to RCLootCouncil, so that it may be updated without any changes to the core project. Instead patches, hooks, and replacements are implemented to modify the core addon to function within the Classic environment.

This also allows for future updates of RCLootCouncil to be easily implemented, as it's mostly core features that need changing for Classic.


### Removed
List of things removed from the original RCLootCouncil addon, as these are no longer needed or available in WoW Classic:

* Loot Status
